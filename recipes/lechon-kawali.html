      </li>
      <li class="">
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Fry pork in the hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 3 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Remove fried pork with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined
        plate.
